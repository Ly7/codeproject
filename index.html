	<h2>Why I choose to learn coding with Code First Girls</h2>
</div>

<br />
<p>I got stuck - a lot - when I tried it on my own. I tried to learn it through websites and free online course - not so easy if don't know where to start.
	<br />
	<br />
So now, with Code First for Girls, if I get stuck, they help me out. And you know what? It sometimes is a very small mistake like forgetting to close a div or a double space instead of a single one.
	<br />
	<br />
I love the course as it is simple and easy to understand and encourages you to create your own website.
I never thought I could have my own website within a few weeks, but here I go. Join the fun - <strong> It is for free!!!! </strong>

<h3>How does it work?</h3><br />
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
There are 7 one-hour weekly sessions where you are taken through the course content and then you will use the newly learned code in several exercises. This helps you understand how coding language works and how it is to be used.</li>
<br />
<li>After the session, there is some at home practice which shouldn't take more that 4 hours a week. This helps you anchor what you have learned and you can implement it on your own website.</li>
<br />
<li>You would need to attend all sessions as they are all linked together and you may not understand parts of it otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</p></div>

<div id='second' class='second'>
	<h3>What will I learn?</h3><br />

		<li> <strong>week 3:</strong> What is Twitter Bootstrap? How does it help me to design websites? How do I use and modify it?</li><br />
		<li> <strong>week 4:</strong> THE Project! Show us what you can do already!</li><br />
